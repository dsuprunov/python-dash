**Web Application for Analysts**

**Objective:**
Create a web application that empowers analysts to perform three distinct operations with specific requirements.

**Prerequisite Task: Create and Import SQLite-Compatible Normalized Database from CSV**
- Before proceeding with other tasks, create an SQLite-compatible normalized database.
- Import relevant data from the provided `census.csv` file into the database to facilitate subsequent tasks efficiently.

**Task 1: Dataset Display Tab**
- Users should be able to view a human-readable form of a dataset pulled from a database table.
- Provide a dropdown menu allowing users to select a target table from the database for data display.
- Implement functionality to allow users to filter out unnecessary columns, offering flexibility in customizing their dataset view. For instance, users may choose to display data only from columns related to age and income.

**Task 2: Data Visualization Tab**
- Design a second tab for users to visualize data from the database based on applied filters.
- Allow users to filter the dataset to derive valuable insights.
- Enable users to export visualizations in formats such as .png or .jpg for further analysis or reporting.

**Task 3: Dataset Export Tab**
- Develop a third tab that facilitates the export of a subset of the dataset pulled from the database.
- Implement user-friendly controls for specifying the subset to be exported.
- Ensure the exported data is in a convenient format for external use.

**Requirements:**
- The web application should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
